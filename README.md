# How To Easily Merge Multiple Jupyter Notebooks Into One

This repository gives solutions that allow you to manipulate and reorganize Jupyter Notebooks in an easy, time-efficient way.

- The first solution is a created Pyhton script to merge two 
dummy Notebooks based on their inner structure. It is detailed in the file 
**script1.py**

- The second solution uses a library created by the Jupyter Development Team
called [nbformat](https://pypi.org/project/nbformat/). You'll find the full code 
for how to use it to merge two Notebooks in the file **script2.py**
